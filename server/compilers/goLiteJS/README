Milestone 1 Instructions:

Milestone 2 Instructions:
  * The filename of the Go program must always be the *first* argument to the compiler. The `-dumpsymtab` and `-pptype` flags can come after in any order. The arguments to `run.sh` are passed directly to the compiler as is.
  We implemented the original return statements from the golite specification, that is, the implementation that did not consider break statements and that in some cases are invalid Go programs

Milestone 4 Instructions:
  * The outputted javascript file with the compiled code will be generated in whatever directory you're currently in.
